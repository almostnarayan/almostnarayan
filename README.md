# Hello! I'm Narayan. 👋
An aspiring **developer** and **designer** (maybe) with a passion for creating aesthetic-looking websites. ✨

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, Git, and GitHub.
- ✍🏼 I'm also writing blogs and sharing useful insights.
- 👀 Other than coding, I’m interested in human psychology, Japanese animations, and 🎼 Music.
- 📫 You can reach out to me via Twitter/X.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Narayan is not my real name.
